*  General Notes ***********************
****************************************
*									   
*  - The executable game file is in    
*  'source' directory.				   
*									   
*  - You can play with your custom     
*  map; to do so place your 'map.txt'  
*  in 'map' directory.				   
*  									   
*  - You can customize your graphics   
*  with customize option in main menu  
*  where a South Park theme is 		   
*  available too.

*  Technical Notes  ********************
****************************************
*									   
*  - Comment/delete the first line	   
*  define (10) in 'server.cpp' if you  
*  don't want fatal error logs shown   
*  in terminal, and the second (11)    
*  for logs written in 'log.txt'	   
*									   
*  - All 4 sources 'My_Graphic.h',     
*  'My_Player.h', 'My_Monster.h', and  
*  'server.cpp' are completely 		   
*  independent and any of them could   
*  be replaced by any other working    
*  independent source. 				    
*  									   
*  - 'Intelligence.h' is used by	   
*  'My_Player.h', 'My_Monster.h' and   
*  'server.cpp' (independently and     
*  without interference).			   
*									   
*  - 'data' directory is used by 	   
*  'My_Graphic.h'					   
*									   
*  - 'map' and 'log' directories are   
*  used by 'server.cpp'			   
*									   
*  - SFML 1.6 has been used for		   
*  graphics. You can visit this	  	   
*  website for getting it (or later    
*  versions): http://sfml-dev.org/
